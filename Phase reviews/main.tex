\section{Phase review}
\subsection{Planning for the phase}
Since the topic of the current phase was "requirement analysis" we tried to give ourselves tasks that would make us familiar the the problems and technologies of the project. We divided the work into a mathematical , a programming and a recreational part.
\subsection{Phase execution}
After some research we redesigned our initial project draft, to make it more suitable for the task. With our new found information we set out and proved the math we will be using in the back-end. Then we built a dummy that is running on a django web-server for testing and visualization purposes. Lastly we made diagrams to evaluate our ideas and our dummy for later.
\subsection{Conclusion}
Now that all the requirement work is done, we are able to go into a final design and functionality evaluation and then we are ready for our first coding sprint. The ground work we layed in this current phase proved, that our ideas and concepts are feasible and we will try to finalize everything in the near future to start implementing our ideas.
